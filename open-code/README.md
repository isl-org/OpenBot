OpenBot Playground is a drag and drop platform to support OpenBot application, where anyone can build instructions for
the robot.

## Getting Started

You can run this application directly from the [Link](https://www.playground.openbot.org/ "Link").

You can also run it locally via creating a local copy of the project. To achieve this, navigate into
the `openBot/open-code` folder, [set firebase project](src/services/README.md) and run application.
After [firebase setup](src/services/README.md) run following commands:

If you're using npm

```bash
npm install
```

In case of yarn

```bash
yarn install
```

Run application

```bash
npm start
```

### Application Features

1. Sync your Google Drive with the OpenBot, and it will automatically save the data on it.
2. Store the data into local storage.
3. Scan the output QR directly from the OpenBot application to run the program.
4. In OpenBot mobile apps, after logging in, you can retrieve the saved files from Google Drive and load them with just
   one click.
5. Design the instructions for OpenBot with zero code.
6. Fully responsive design optimized for mobile and tablet browsing.

### Project Storage

This project allows users to store their data both locally and on `Google Drive`. When the project is created, it is
automatically stored in the `local storage` of the user's device. As changes are made to the project, the local storage
is updated in real-time.

Additionally, users can upload their project to Google Drive by clicking on the [upload button](#generate-Code). This
allows users to access their project from any device with internet access, making it easier to work on the project from
different locations.

- #### Local Storage
  Local storage is a built-in web technology that allows web applications to store data locally within the user's
  browser. This means that the project is stored on the user's device and can be accessed without an internet
  connection.

  In this project, the local storage is used to store the project whenever changes are made to it. The project is stored
  in the browser's cache, which means that it will persist even if the user closes the tab or the browser.

- #### Google Drive Storage
  Google Drive is a cloud-based storage service provided by Google. It allows users to store and share files online, as
  well as access them from any device with internet access.

  In this project, users can upload their project to Google Drive by clicking on the upload icon when they are signed in
  to the website. The project is then stored on the user's Google Drive account, which means that it can be accessed
  from any device with internet access.

  To access their project from Google Drive, users can simply log in to their Google account and navigate
  to [my projects](#project-section), where all their stored projects will be displayed.

## OpenBot Playground Screens

### Home Page

The `OpenBot Playground` starts with homepage that contains following component:

- [Header](#header) : Header contains the following two sections, change theme and sign-in user.
- [Carousel](#Carousal):Carousal's Content Explains how the Playground works.
- [Project Section](#project-section) :Project section contains List of Projects and Create new Project button.

### Playground Page

The `Playground` page is a key feature of the `OpenBot Playground` platform that provides a variety of coding blocks for
users to create different types of functionality, such as Control, Loops, Movement, Operators, Sensors, and many more.

- [Header](#header) : Header contains project name, help centre, AutoSync ,change theme and signIn user section.
- [Workspace](#workSpace): Space where users can drag and drop the coding blocks to generate their code, which can be
  converted into both JavaScript and Python.
- [Playground Bottom Bar](#Playground-Bottom-Bar) : Bottom bar Contains buttons to generate code ,upload project in
  drive, zoom in and out blocks ,Add model ,undo and redo changes in workspace.

### Header

The header of the `Openbot-Playground` website has its logo in the top left section. The right side of the header have
two buttons.

- #### Change theme
  Theme icon allows you to switch between light mode and dark mode, and vice versa.

  <img style="padding-right: 2%;" src="../docs/images/playground_home_dark_theme_screen.jpg" alt="dark theme screen" width="45%"/>
  </p>

- #### Sign-in

  The "Sign-in" button opens a Google sign-in popup on the screen and prompts you to enter your email for login, with
  all necessary permissions granted, including modifying ***Google Drive***.
  <p align="left">
  <img style="padding-right: 2%;" src="../docs/images/playground_sign-in.gif" alt="Playground Sign In" width="60%" height="20%"/>
  </p>

- #### Profile Options
  Upon successful sign-in, you will have options to edit your profile and log out. The "Edit Profile" button opens a
  popup where you can update your profile image, display name and date of birth.

  <img style="padding-right: 2%;" src="../docs/images/playground_edit_profile_modal.jpg" alt="Playground Sign In" width="45%" />
  </p>

- #### AutoSync:
    - AutoSync enables users to seamlessly synchronize all machine learning models (Tflite models), from the OpenBot
      robot app and conveniently display them in their respective ``Artificial Intelligence`` blocks. Additionally,
      users have the flexibility to select the desired AI model directly within the block interface while structuring
      the code.
    - #### How it works
        - The robot app uploads an updated config.json file to the user's Google Drive, including any newly added
          models. This file lists all the models along with their configurations in JSON format.
        - When the user clicks on ``Auto Sync`` all downloaded models, including those for detection, autopilot, and
          point goal navigation, are filtered and displayed in their respective AI blocks.
        - Following this process, the model will then appear within the OpenBot playground blocks. With the assistance
          of
          Google Drive, you can seamlessly select this model directly from the respective AI blocks.

- #### Playground page additional

    - The Playground page header retains the same design as the homepage header, while incorporating additional
      functionalities. In the center, the project name is displayed with a downward arrow, providing options for
      renaming and deleting the project.

       </p>

    - On the right side, a help button has been added, featuring three sections that explain how to effectively
      drag and drop blocks, save and download project progress, and upload to drive for seamless collaboration.

</p>

### Project Section

The 'My Projects' section display the projects stored in local storage and Google Drive (if the user is signed in), with
each project showing its name, creation/edit date, and previous block versions. Clicking on a project redirects the user
to its playground page. To create a new project, simply click on the `create icon`.

Clicking the 'Create' icon opens a 'Create New Project' popup with an input for the project name and a 'Create' button.
Once a suitable name is entered and the 'Create' button or enter is pressed, the project's playground screen will open.
If the user enters a name already assigned to another project, the system will automatically generate a unique name by
appending an integer to the end of the name.

<img style="padding-right: 2%;" src="../docs/images/playground_my_project_option.jpg" alt="option" width="30%"/>
</p>

### WorkSpace

To generate code, users can drag and drop coding blocks into the workspace. The code can be converted into both
JavaScript and Python.

- Blocks can be selected from the left section and dropped into the workspace as needed.
- To delete a block, users can simply drag it to the trash icon located in the bottom right corner.
- If a block does not fit into the "Start" or "Forever" block, it will be disabled to prevent errors in the generated
  code.
- Users can restore a deleted block from the trash by clicking on it, which will display a list of deleted blocks.
  They can then drag and drop the desired block from the trash back into the workspace.

### Playground Bottom Bar

- To ensure a successful web experience of the openBot-PlayGround using Google Drive, users should fulfill the following
  conditions:
    - User should not have any other folder in their Google Drive with the same name as the website generated
      openBot-PlayGround folder.
    - User should not create same name file in openBot-PlayGround folder.

    <p></p>
  <img style="padding-right: 2%;" src="../docs/images/playground_drive.jpg" alt="Generate Code" width="45%"/>

- #### Generate Code
  Generate Code button on the Playground bottom bar serves three important functions. Firstly, it generates a QR code
  that represents the link of the JavaScript/Python file uploaded to the user's Google Drive as part of the project. This QR
  code is displayed in a side window for easy access and sharing. Secondly, the button uploads a JavaScript/Python
  file containing the code for the project to the user's Google Drive. And lastly, uploading an XML file which
  represents the current project's block configuration. This XML file contains the structure and arrangement of the blocks used in the
  project.

    - `Convenient Sharing` -
      The QR code generated by the button provides a public shareable link to the JavaScript/Python file on Google
      Drive.
      This link can be accessed by scanning the QR code using the OpenBot IOS/Android app. This allows users to run the
      car
      based on the code generated using the coding blocks directly from their mobile device. The ability to share the QR
      code and access the code on mobile devices adds another level of convenience and accessibility to the openBot
      playground.
      The integration with Google Drive allows you to have a comprehensive backup of their project. By including the XML
      file, the exact structure and logic of the blocks used in the project are preserved. This is beneficial for you to
      share,
      collaborate, and revisiting projects in the future.

  </p>

- #### Code Editor
  Code editor button on right side of generate QR button, opens a side window displaying block code in a scripting
  language. The button provides options to choose between two languages, either JavaScript or Python, and once selected,
  users can only view their code snippets in the side window. They can toggle between JavaScript and Python to see the
  corresponding code in the side window simultaneously. The options to choose a language enables you to examine and
  evaluate the correctness of the blocks.

  </p>

- #### Add Model
  The OpenBot playground provides a feature to externally add AI model (.tflite) to robot application. The model popup
  allows user to edit the configuration of our model, including its name, type, class, and input size. Note that the
  model will
  automatically saved in the user's Google Drive, along with the updated config.json file.
