# OpenBot: Robot Body

In principle, you can build any wheeled robot body around a microcontroller such as the Arduino Nano to use with the OpenBot software stack. We have designed a [3D-printed body](diy) for a wheeled robot which relies on low-cost, readily available hobby hardware. [OpenBot Lite](lite) is a smaller and simplified variant of the OpenBot DIY version developed for education. Even if you do not want to build it, you may find the [step-by-step video guides](lite/#step-by-step-video-guides) helpful. We have also designed a [3D-printed body](rc_truck) for commercially available 1:16 RC-Trucks (such as [this](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00M3J7DJW) one).

Below are a number of examples with build instructions:
