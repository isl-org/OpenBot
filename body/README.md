</p>

We have designed a body for a wheeled robot which relies on low-cost, readily available hobby hardware.

## Chassis

### 3D printing

You will need to print the following parts in order to build your OpenBot.

1) body_bottom ([STL](cad/regular_body/body_bottom.stl), [STEP](cad/regular_body/body_bottom.step))
2) body_top ([STL](cad/regular_body/body_top.stl), [STEP](cad/regular_body/body_top.step))
3) phone_mount_bottom ([STL](cad/phone_mount/phone_mount_bottom.stl), [STEP](cad/phone_mount/phone_mount_bottom.step))
4) phone_mount_top ([STL](cad/phone_mount/phone_mount_top.stl), [STEP](cad/phone_mount/phone_mount_top.step))

For the above parts, your build plate needs to be at least 240mmx150mm.

Since a lot of common 3D printers have a smaller build volume, we have also made a [slim body](cad/slim_body/README.md) which fits on a 220mmx220mm build plate at 45 degrees.

For printing on 3D printers with even smaller build volumes, there is also a [glueable body](cad/glue_body/README.md) which fits on a 150mmx140mm build plate. Thanks to @sloretz.

On an Ultimaker S5, we achieved good results with the following settings:

- layer height: 0.2mm
- wall thickness: 1.5mm
- infill density: 20%
- infill pattern: grid
- print speed 80 mm/s
- no support

We were able to print the chassis with PLA, ABS and CPE. In our experience the print was not affected very much by the print settings. However, if you have the patience, printing slower and with smaller layer height will improve the print. Also adding a support structure can improve the print, but it will require additional work to remove afterwards.

Before you proceed with the build, you may need to clean the 3D print.

### Alternatives

If you do not have access to a 3D printer, there are several Arduino robot car kits available which you can use as a starting point. These kits come with a chassis, motors and accessories. We recommend to get a basic kit, since you won't need a lot of the electronics and sensors of the more expensive kits. Here are some options:

- Perseids DIY Robot Smart Car Chassis Kit ([EU](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07DNXBNHY), [US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DNXBFQN))
- SZDoit 4WD Smart Metal Robot Car Chassis Kit ([US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083K4RKBP), [AE](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33048227237.html))
- Joy-it Robot Car Kit 01 ([EU](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B073ZGJF28))
- Smart Car Kit 4WD Smart Robot Car Chassis Kit ([AE](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001238626191.html))

You will also need a phone mount. Here is one option:

- Mpow Dashboard Car Phone Mount ([EU](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0762GS7MS), [US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BYFP9BZ))

You can also get creative and build your own OpenBot chassis and phone mount using a material of your choice (e.g. wood, cardboard, styrofoam, etc.). If you do, please post some pictures on the [Slack channel](https://github.com/intel-isl/OpenBot#contact) so others can admire your creativity. Here is one example by [@custom-build-robots](https://custom-build-robots.com/roboter/openbot-dein-smartphone-steuert-ein-roboter-auto-chassis-bauen/13636):

</p>

## Assembly

There are two different options for assembly of the robot, DIY and PCB. The DIY approach relies on the popular L298N motor driver and is recommended for hobbyists with some electronics experience. It requires a fair amount of wiring, especially if all the sensors and LEDs are installed. However, all components are readily available in most contries and especially for single builds or just to try out the project, the DIY option is recommended. In order to reduce the wiring and make assembly easier, we have also developed a [custom PCB](pcb). This is recommended if you desire a cleaner build or want to build multiple OpenBots.

**Tip:** To make all the wiring easier you can build a small power distributor for the 5V and GND connections by soldering a 6x2 male header to a perfboard. Then connect the power distributor with the 5V / GND of the motor driver.

1. Solder wires to the motors and add the encoder disks to the two front motors if you intend to use the speed sensors.
