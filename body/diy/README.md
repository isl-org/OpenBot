We have designed a body for a wheeled robot which relies on low-cost, readily available hobby hardware. You can find instructions for building you own robot below. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us. Happy robot building!

## Chassis

### 3D printing

You will need to print and assemble the following parts in order to build your OpenBot.

#### Robot body

There are several options for the robot body depending on your needs and capabilities of your 3D printer. We encourage you to design and build your own, but here are some options as starting point: 

- [Regular body](cad/regular_body/README.md): This is the standard body we designed; it requires a build plate with least 240mmx150mm.
- [Slim body](cad/slim_body/README.md): Since a lot of common 3D printers have a smaller build volume, we have also designed a smaller version without bumpers which fits on a 220mmx220mm build plate at 45 degrees.
- [Glueable body](cad/glue_body/README.md): For printing on 3D printers with even smaller build volumes, there is also a modular body designed by @sloretz with serveral parts that need to be glued together; it fits on a 150mmx140mm build plate.
- [Blocky body](cad/block_body/README.md): This body designed by @Christos-Ps provides multiple variants with options for extra space inside the shell and a lego-compatible top while maintaining a small footprint that requires only 221mmx150mm for printing.

#### Phone mount

In addition, you will need to print a phone mount to be fixed to robot body.

- phone_mount_bottom ([STL](../phone_mount/phone_mount_bottom.stl), [STEP](../phone_mount/phone_mount_bottom.step))
- phone_mount_top ([STL](../phone_mount/phone_mount_top.stl), [STEP](../phone_mount/phone_mount_top.step))

#### Cleaning

Before you proceed with the build, you may need to clean the 3D print.

</p>

### Alternatives

If you do not have access to a 3D printer, there are several Arduino robot car kits available which you can use as a starting point. These kits come with a chassis, motors and accessories. We recommend to get a basic kit, since you won't need a lot of the electronics and sensors of the more expensive kits. Here are some options:

- Perseids DIY Robot Smart Car Chassis Kit ([EU](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07DNXBNHY), [US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DNXBFQN))
- SZDoit 4WD Smart Metal Robot Car Chassis Kit ([US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083K4RKBP), [AE](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33048227237.html))
- Joy-it Robot Car Kit 01 ([EU](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B073ZGJF28))
- Smart Car Kit 4WD Smart Robot Car Chassis Kit ([AE](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001238626191.html))

You will also need a phone mount. Here are some options:

- Phone Mount ([EU](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B06XDYJNSR), [US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CY8MC2R))

You can also get creative and build your own OpenBot chassis and phone mount using a material of your choice (e.g. wood, cardboard, styrofoam, etc.). If you do, please post some pictures on the [Slack channel](https://github.com/intel-isl/OpenBot#contact) so others can admire your creativity. Here is one example by [@custom-build-robots](https://custom-build-robots.com/roboter/openbot-dein-smartphone-steuert-ein-roboter-auto-chassis-bauen/13636):

## Assembly

There are two different options for assembly of the robot, DIY and PCB. The DIY approach relies on the popular L298N motor driver and is recommended for hobbyists with some electronics experience. It requires a fair amount of wiring, especially if all the sensors and LEDs are installed. However, all components are readily available in most contries and especially for single builds or just to try out the project, the DIY option is recommended. In order to reduce the wiring and make assembly easier, we have also developed a [custom PCB](pcb). This is recommended if you desire a cleaner build or want to build multiple OpenBots.

**Tip:** To make all the wiring easier you can build a small power distributor for the 5V and GND connections by soldering a 6x2 male header to a perfboard. Then connect the power distributor with the 5V / GND of the motor driver.

1. Solder wires to the motors and add the encoder disks to the two front motors if you intend to use the speed sensors.
