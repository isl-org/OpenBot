There are several ways for controlling the OpenBot robot.

## Bluetooth Controller

The easiest way to control the robot is to connect a game controller via bluetooth. Most BT game controllers should work. We have tested the [PS4 controller](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Sony-Dualshock-Gamepad-Playstation-Black/dp/B01LYWPQUN), [XBox controller](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/QAT-00002/dp/B07SDFLVKD) and several aftermarket controllers such as the [X3](https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Wireless-Joystick-Bluetooth-Android/dp/B08H5MM64P).

## [Node.js Controller](node-js)

This controller requires your phone and a computer (e.g. laptop, rasberry PI) to be connected to the same WiFi network. After successful connection you get a live low-latency video feed and can use your keyboard to control the robot from the browser.

## [Python Controller](python)

This controller requires your phone and a computer (e.g. laptop, rasberry PI) to be connected to the same WiFi network. After successful connection you get a live RTSP video stream and can use your keyboard to control the robot from the terminal. You can use the Python script as a template to develop your own controller.
